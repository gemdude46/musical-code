		<p>Musical Code is a game in which you are given an objective to solve in the beginning of the game. You have to start the code, and you have five minutes to do that. Then, you get the code of a random person, which you have three minutes to do. The code will then be shuffled and you will get another random piece of code, which you have three minutes to continue. This continues until someone finishes a piece of code to meet an objective.</p>
